Iâ€™m an entry-level cybersecurity student pursuing a B.S. and A.S. in Cybersecurity with a CompTIA Security+ certification. Currently preparing for CySA+, SC-900, and AZ-900 to deepen my technical foundation.

## Objective

I aim to break into the cybersecurity field through roles such as SOC Analyst, Cloud Security Support, and GRC/Compliance Specialist. I am currently focused on earning the CySA+ to build blue team and threat detection expertise, followed by SC-900 and AZ-900 to gain Microsoft cloud and security compliance proficiency. As I progress, I plan to pursue intermediate-to-advanced certifications, including the CCNA, CISM, and AWS Security Specialty, to qualify for high-impact, high-earning roles across cloud, governance, and security architecture tracks.
